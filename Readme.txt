The model defiend the landscape range fisrtly.

Runoff Factor -> rainfall data (2016-2020yr) Sample -> text 

1. how to divided event

2. continous event is one event (within XX hours)

3. Estimate average CN value > estimate the amount of effective rainfall 

4. calculate event with specific data(year-month: YYYY-MM)


K -> extract K value from the soil map. - 1 map
 
LS -> DEM -> Slope/ Slope Length (Ref.) - 1 map.

C -> 1. Land type 2. Crop -> Monthly C factor map. -> 12 map.
 
P -> depend on the characteristics of farmer (education/farm size/earn)
